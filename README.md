## Postboard Protocol Document

## Tools Used

This Postboard application uses various Bitcoin and web-related tools for different things:

- [**React**](https://reactjs.org) We use React to render the webpage UI for this application, and track the state of the page.
- [**MUI**](https://mui.com) We use a UI framework within React called MUI to help with page styling, text fields, buttons and dialog boxes.
- [**Bitcoin SV**](https://bitcoinsv.com) We use the Bitcoin SV blockchain to timestamp and register our posts, and we rely on *satoshis* (a measurement of Bitcoin), so that the post tokens are valuable.
- [**Babbage SDK**](https://github.com/p2ppsr/babbage-sdk) We use the Babbage SDK so that users are able to have a Bitcoin-native identity, and can create and redeem Bitcoin tokens. The SDK also allows us to easily encrypt task data for added user privacy.
- [**PushDrop**](https://github.com/p2ppsr/pushdrop) We use PushDrop to create Bitcoin tokens that follow the Postboard protocol. PushDrop makes it easier to add data payloads to tokens, while still being able to give them value and spend them.
